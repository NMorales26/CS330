Project Reflection Questions

1. How do I approach designing software?

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on this 3D scene project has helped me develop several crucial design skills:
- Breaking down complex objects into basic geometric shapes (like the lamp being composed of cylinders and cones)
- Planning lighting systems with multiple light sources and their interactions
- Designing modular code structures with reusable components (like the CreateLamp(), CreateMonitor() functions)
- Creating intuitive camera controls that work harmoniously with the scene

What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process followed these steps:
1. Initial scene planning and object identification from the reference image
2. Breaking down complex objects into basic OpenGL shapes
3. Planning the lighting system to enhance scene visibility
4. Designing the texture management system
5. Creating modular functions for each major component
6. Implementing user controls for scene navigation
7. Iterative refinement based on visual feedback

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
These design tactics can be applied to future projects by:
- Using component-based design for complex systems
- Starting with basic implementations and iteratively adding complexity
- Planning for modularity from the beginning
- Maintaining clear separation of concerns in code organization

2. How do I approach developing programs?

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I implemented several new development strategies:
- Using transformation matrices for precise object positioning
- Implementing shader programs for lighting and textures
- Managing multiple texture resources efficiently
- Creating reusable functions for common operations
- Debugging 3D graphics using OpenGL debugging tools

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was crucial in several ways:
1. Started with basic shapes and refined their positions
2. Gradually improved lighting from basic to complex
3. Incrementally added textures to enhance realism
4. Continuously refined camera controls based on testing
5. Iteratively adjusted object scales and proportions to match the reference image

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?
My development approach evolved significantly:
- Started with basic object creation and positioning
- Added proper lighting and shadow systems
- Implemented texture mapping and material properties
- Created more modular and reusable code
- Improved code organization and documentation
- Enhanced user interaction capabilities
